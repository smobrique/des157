         <p>One of the biggest challenges that people of color have recently faced is within the realm of technological diversity and the inadvertant erasure of people of color.</p>
         <p>For instance, photo editing/beauty apps include options to remove blemishes and other imperfections. However, this option usually leads to whitening the skin as opposed to removing blemishes to give the face a more airbrushed finish. These options can further enhance the features of already light-skinned people, but for people of color who have darker skin, this facial enhancing option causes their skin to become whitewashed instead.</p>
         <p>If there were more beauty apps that were all-encompassing and more inclusive to those of richer skin color, it would negate the whitewashing factor when people edit their photos.</p>
