        <h3>Critiques from Adam:</h3>
        <ol><li><b>Make the buttons on the About & Narrative pages more interactive</b> - When Adam hovered over a button, he noticed that the button didn't do anything when the mouse hovered over them. It would have made more sense for the button color to change or something to make it more obvious that the button was being hovered over.</li>
         <li><b>Make the narratives more immersive</b> - Instead of using text, adding links in the narrative to lead to the person's links or some type of visual imagery would make the narrative more immersive.</li>
          </ol>

        <h3>Critiques from Sophia:</h3>
        <ol><li><b>Add down arrow from homepage slides</b> - Sophia noted that she thought the Homepage slideshow would actually lead to another page, so adding an indication that there's more below the slideshow would be more helpful.</li>
          <li><b>Add a call to action instead of using Contact</b> - Since the narratives are based on people within the Fil-Am, utilizing the Contact page in order to link to other Fil-Am pages would be more effective than having people contact me personally.</li>
          <li><b>Add a preview line in people's Narrative boxes</b> - Sophia said mentioning which Fil-Am organization people affiliate themselves with would help people filter through the organizations more clearly in case there are more narratives added in the future.</li>
</ol>
