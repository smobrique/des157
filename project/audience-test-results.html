        <h3>Critiques from Adam:</h3>
        <ol><li><b>Use smoother scrolling</b> - As he scrolled through the website, it seemed kind of static, whereas on other websites, it scrolls up on its own and leads to the next "page."</li>
          <li><b>Make the buttons on the About and Narratives pages more interactive</b> - When Adam hovered over the buttons, he noticed that the buttons didn't do anything when the mouse hovered over them. It would have made more sense for the button color to change or something to make it more obvious that the button was being hovered over.</li>
          <li><b>Add an option to click out of the Narrative overlay in order to close the window as opposed to leaving an X in the corner</b> - Adam pointed out how finding the X on the overlay was a little bit difficult because it was stuck in the top right corner.</li></ol>

        <h3>Critiques from Sophia:</h3>
        <ol><li><b>Add down arrow from homepage slides</b> - Sophia noted that she thought the Homepage slideshow would actually lead to another page, so adding an indication that there's more below the slideshow would be more helpful.</li>
          <li><b>Make the narratives more immersive</b> - Instead of using text, adding links in the narrative to lead to the person's links or some type of visual imagery would make the narrative more immersive.</li>
          <li><b>Add a call to action instead of using Contact</b> - Since the narratives are based on people within the Fil-Am, utilizing the Contact page in order to link to other Fil-Am pages would be more effective than having people contact me personally.</li>
          <li><b>Add a preview line in people's Narrative boxes</b> - Sophia said mentioning which Fil-Am organization people affiliate themselves with would help people filter through the organizations more clearly in case there are more narratives added in the future.</li>
