        <ul><li><b>Topic Summary:</b> This project involves bringing awareness to cultures that lack representation, or are constantly misrepresented - primarily in the Southeast Asian region.</li>
          <li><b>Target Audience Description:</b> As mentioned above, the project is primarily targeted towards Southeast Asian communities.</li>
          <li><b>Project Goals:</b>
            <ul><li>Educate and inform others of cultures that exists outside of Eastern Asia.</li>
            <li>Emphasize the importance of unity within marginalized communities.</li>
            <li>Raise awareness towards those in the community that are constantly oppressed.</li></ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Overall look & feel:</b></li> I want the project to be a space of storytelling from various perspectives. I think I'm going to incorporate videos into my project to display for a desktop viewport. So far, my overall look is going to involve a wide range of colors, because Southeast Asian cultures aren't just black and white - they're very vibrant. I want to be able to embody their vibrant attitudes through my color palettes. I haven't thought about how everything's going to be set up quite yet, but I would imagine everything to be laid out in a very cohesive manner in a way that's easy for peopel to navigate through.</ul>
