        <p>The first storyboard is an interactive mobile app that provides demographics and statistics for racial diversity. Users just have to allow their locations, then it will lead to a dropdown menu that allows people to input their ethnicity. It will pinpoint how many users within that ethnic group are in the same location to provide more visual results on certain demographics. I personally feel like this idea will be too broad, and a critique that I was given was that only certain people who need the demographics will be using this. This would not necessarily be needed for an everday type of use.</p>

        <img src="/des157/images/storyboard2.jpg" alt="Second Storyboard">
        <p>The second storyboard is more of an interactive game where people can make their own characters and interact with non-player characters. If you press on certain locations, it'll pull up fun facts about the chosen location. One of the critiques that I got is that making a wide range of characters to signify cultural diversity would be especially difficult for a short timeframe, so I think it would be easier just to premake a character and create diverse non-player characters.</p>
