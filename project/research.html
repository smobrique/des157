        <p>When people think of diversity, they automatically think of skin color. But it's much more than that. Diversity, at least in the realm of digital works, can mean having a wide range of skills and bringing fresh ideas to the table. It’s all about taking people with the right kind of mindset and skill set more seriously than taking people seriously because of their skin color. For my project, I want to be able to focus on those who grew up with a lack of proper representation and made themselves known in this ever-growing technological community - the underdogs, if you will.</p>

<p>There are three main factors that should be taken into consideration when being involved with diversity: the customers that wish to buy the product, the interactions that the customer will have with the product, and the holistic community who buys the product. Many technological advances have been geared towards universal usage with interfaces that are easy to understand and relatively simple to use. The iPhone, for example, has been a staple smartphone since the early 2000s and has been sold to billions of customers on a global scale. It can be programmed into nearly any language for ease of access, with more and more language support being added with each iOS update. This easily makes the iPhone one of the most diverse pieces of technology to date.</p>

<p>It’s not to say that technology geared towards a worldwide audience is perfect, though. With the newest features that come with the iPhone X, there have been several drawbacks. The phone is offered sans its home button, so an on-screen fingerprint must be used to unlock the phone. Alternatively, users can use the facial recognition feature in order to unlock the phone. One of the biggest problems that people of color (primarily Eastern Asians) is that the phone could be unlocked by person A, but also by person B because the phone thinks their faces are the exact same.</p>

<p>Again, this isn’t an issue of race or skin color. Instead, it is simply a problem of limited thinking and limited design solutions. Proper product functionality does not shine through to its fullest, nor does it live up to its universal advertisements when the product works for only a niche audience. One of the most important factors in properly ensuring that any organization, especially with technology, is inclusive, it’s important to be reaching communities that a person wants to connect with. What I want to do with my project is break the barriers of these limited design solutions and create pathways for diverse thinking to shine through, whether it be in new product design or otherwise.</p>
