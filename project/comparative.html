        <b>First Project: Who Am I?</b>
         <p>The first project I researched is a mobile app called, “Who Am I? Race Awareness Game.” The app was developed in order to stimulate discussions between parents and children about racial diversity, ethnicity and cultures. It is a two-player game meant for both the parent and the child. Both players will see a set of different faces, and the first player selects the face while the second player tries to guess which face the first player chose. The second player can ask questions in a manner similar to the traditional game, “Guess Who?” in order to eliminate their choices. Once the second player guesses correctly, players get to read more about each selected person. The interface design is very simple, and the faces of each person are laid next to each other in a 6 x 4 grid. However, even though the game is made to be a guessing game, there is actually no way of eliminating the choices if Player 2 guesses incorrectly. If Player 2 guesses incorrectly, it simply shows the photo of the person in a bigger window with a red frame, then the photo is returned to the grid. The interactivity of the game only goes as far as showing the facts of each person, rather than eliminating wrong choices. This app does serve its purpose in educating people about racial diversity, but it does not work much as a game, let alone one that children would want to continuously play. A way to maybe improve this app would be to allow players to actually see which answers are correct and which answers are wrong, then allow the players to see the facts of each face after the game is over.

         <b>Second Project: Toca Life - School</b>
        <p>The second project is another mobile app called “Toca Life: School Review.” Essentially, it is a game that caters to children. It lets children create a character that lives a “rule-free” academic life. The character designs strike a very strong resemblance to Pop figurines. “Toca Life” also allows children characters’ to interact with non-player characters to create a band, send love letters, etc. One of the strongest features of this game is that it is very inclusive of all types of people. There is a huge range of skin tones, a variety of hair colors and even wheelchairs for characters who are disabled. The game is a simple and straightforward way to help kids understand how people are different and how those differences should be celebrated. In comparison to the first project, it is much more user-friendly and encourages more user interactivity. There are goals that have to be met in order to advance further in the game, which can act as the driving force for children to continue playing.</p>
