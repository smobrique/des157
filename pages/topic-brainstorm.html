         <p>One of the biggest challenges that people of color have recently faced is within the realm of technological diversity and the inadvertant erasure of people of color. For instance, photo editing/beauty apps include options to remove blemishes and other imperfections. However, this option usually leads to whitening the skin as opposed to removing blemishes to give the face a more airbrushed finish. 
          These options can further enhance the features of already light-skinned people, but for people of color who have darker skin, this facial enhancing option causes their skin to become whitewashed instead. Similarly, there are video games that are created that allow players to create characters. These characters often are only comprised of multiple light skin options and only offer, at most, one skintone for darker skin.</p>
