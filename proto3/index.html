    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is a website project based on the narratives of multiple students involved with the Filipinx-American community at University of California, Davis. Coming into Davis as a Southeast Asian-identifying student often means tackling the societal pressures that come with it. People in the minorities are often overlooked and what is considered a safe space for other students can be a brutal warzone against society for others. These narratives serve as a basis to show that despite our upbringings, our background and our perspectives, we still stand together as one community. These narratives are our story in the Fil-Am community.

      <p> I was born in the city Hayward in California, located in the Bay Area (more specifically, East Bay). Getting involved with the Fil-am community was very unexpected for me. I did not know a Filipino-American club even existed in Davis. On the first day of instruction/classes, I sat in my chemistry discussion and next to me was a Filipino girl.  Going into college I wanted to fit in and tried to make as many friends as possible so I decided to make conversation with her.  After class she asked if was Filipino and I answered yes. She then proceeded to ask if I wanted to attend and ice-breaker event with the Fil-Am community and I gladly accepted. Going to that ice-breaker event is where I was introduced to all of the organizations that were within Fil-Am. I really did not expect to meet all my future close friends within this community.
<br><br>Joining the Fil-Am came with many amazing experiences I would not have came across if I decided not to show up to that ice-breaker event. One event that still has a lasting impact and an ongoing experience is what we the Fil-Am community calls Sibs. The big and little sibling program can be seen a mentorship program within the Fil-Am community. Upperclassmen are paired with underclassmen or anyone who signs up for the program who are looking for a mentor, friend, or someone to help guide them through college.  With this program I was able to meet my “sibs” and they have helped guided me through college.  They have been there for me academically, giving me advice on classes, how I should manage my time, and as friends.

<div id="narrative2">
    <p> I grew up in the small province of Mabolo in Malolos, Bulacan where my backyard was probably must have been considered a jungle and we were surrounded by the rice patties. There, life was hard but simple and innocent as us children were content with just playing with the dirt and climbing trees. The houses there were made of wood planks and there was no such thing as a heater or air conditioner. There was no water heater either so we would have to heat a bucket of water on the stove before washing ourselves using a tabo. Since it was a small province, our community had a strong sense of unity as if we were all one family which meant that everyone knew everyone like they were part of their own blood family. The kids called the elders either tita or tito, whereas the adults called all the children anak. Every other night, all the adults would gather together in someone’s house, most of the time it would be mine, and they would all sing songs together and drink while the kids played. On top of having a strong sense of family, our province also had a strong sense of religion and culture. Every Sunday, the church will always be so full that if you were even just one minute late then you would have to stand outside in the blazing hot weather and rely on the speakers to hear the prayers despite having our cathedral so big that it looked like a castle in my toddler eyes. Both private and public schools also administered prayers in the morning, before lunch, and at the end of the school day. Of course, this is in addition to our national pledge and the singing of our national anthem. Every Friday in the schools of my province, a class would typically give a performance that is related to the culture of Philippines. This could take the form of either a dance such as tinikling, or a reenactment of a significant event of our history. 
	  <br><br>Ever since moving to America, I felt that I had slowly strayed away from the values of my province. Moving here when I was ten, I did not know any of my neighbors, nor did I even see them on the weekly basis. All the houses and all the yards looked the same but it was mostly concrete and not very many trees to climb on. I was even shocked by the sight of a garden sprinkler since I didn't even know that it existed. I also did not see any representation of my Philippine culture in my schools growing up either, not up until college. Upon attending UC Davis, I decided to get involved in the FilAm (Filipino-American) community such as Mga Kapatid and Filipino Association for Health Careers (FAHC) as my dad wanted me to become more in tune with my culture. It has only been a month since I have joined and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made since it reminded me of the values I have grown up with. In the FilAm community, I truly feel like I have not just made lasting friends, but people I can consider family. My first event was the MK Big Sib Little Sib Reveal in which I was given a “Big,” or a mentor, that has been the most important bridge I could have acquired going into the FilAm community. Not only have I gotten close to her and to many people because of her, I have also gotten close to many people through the MK Retreat in Lake Tahoe and I still reminisce about that trip even up until today. All the events following that retreat such as the Lazi Cow fundraiser has only strengthened my bond and love for the people I have met in MK. As for FAHC, I have only attended one event so far and it was the Health Conference but it was still the same scenario. Many of my friends that I have met in MK are also part of FAHC and being able to spend time with them and even eat as a family in Jollibee has only grown my fondness for them. I definitely cannot see myself ever leaving this community as not only have they linked me back to my roots, but I also have gained a new family.
